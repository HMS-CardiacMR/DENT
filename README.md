**DENT: Deformation ENcoding Transformer**  


- DENT is currently under review. The trained model will be released upon the manuscript being accepted.

External testing of DENT rate 2 on 4-chamber cines with temporal resolution spacing of 50 – 90 ms. First column, input cine whose original frame rate was reduced by half. Second column, DENT-interpolated cine using rate 2. Third column, original cine. Cines are shown across multiple vendors (rows 1 – 3).

External testing of DENT rate 4 on short axis cine with 144 ms temporal resolution. First column, input cine whose original frame rate was reduced by 4. Second column, DENT-interpolate cine using rate 2 producing a frame rate / 2. Third column, DENT-interpolate cine using rate 2 was applied a second time, which restored the frame rate. Fourth column, original cine.
